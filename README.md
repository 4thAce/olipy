olipy
=====

Olipy is a Python library for artistic text generation. It focuses on
Queneau assembly, a technique pioneered by Raymond Queneau in his 1961
book "Cent mille milliards de po√®mes" ("One hundred million million
poems").

Olipy includes several datasets and sample scripts for generating new
texts by systematically recombining pieces from existing texts:

example.mashteroids.py: Generates names and IAU citations for
minor planets.

example.words.py: Generates common-looking and obscure-looking English
words.
