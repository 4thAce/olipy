olipy
=====

Olipy is a Python library for artistic text generation. It has many
useful modules.

Setup
-----

Olipy uses the [`TextBlob`](https://textblob.readthedocs.org/) library
to parse text. Note that `TextBlob` has extra dependencies (text
corpora) which are not installed as part of the Python package.
Instructions for installing the extra dependencies are on the `TextBlob`
site, but they boil down to running [this Python
script](https://raw.github.com/sloria/TextBlob/master/download_corpora.py).

queneau.py
----------

_Dependencies:_ `TextBlob`

A module for Queneau assembly, a technique pioneered by Raymond
Queneau in his 1961 book "Cent mille milliards de po√®mes" ("One
hundred million million poems"). Queneau assembly randomly creates new
texts from a collection of existing texts with identical structure.

Example scripts for queneau.py:

* example.words.py: Generates common-looking and obscure-looking English
words. Demonstrates Queneau assembly on parts of a word.

* example.mashteroids.py: Generates names and IAU citations for minor
planets. Demonstrates Queneau assembly on sentences.

* example.apollo.py: Generates dialogue between astronauts and Mission
Control. Demonstrates Queneau assembly on dialogue.

* example.boardgame.py: Generates board game names and descriptions.

* example.sonnet.py: Generates Shakespearean sonnets.

* example.dinosaurs.py: Generates dinosaur names.

ebooks.py
---------

_Dependencies:_ `TextBlob`

A module for incongruously sampling texts in the style of the infamous
[https://twitter.com/horse_ebooks](@horse_ebooks). Based on the
[https://twitter.com/zzt_ebooks](@zzt_ebooks) algorithm by Adam
Parrish.

Example scripts for ebooks.py:

* example.horse_ebooks.py: Selects some lines from a Project Gutenberg
  text, with a bias towards the keywords you give it as command-line
  arguments.

markov.py
---------

_Dependencies:_ None

A module for generating new token lists from old token lists using a
Markov chain.

The primary purpose of the olipy library is to promote alternatives to
Markov chains (such as Queneau assembly and the _ebooks algorithm),
but sometimes you really do want a Markov chain. Queneau assembly is
usually better than a Markov chain above the word level (constructing
paragraphs from sentences) and below the word level (constructing
words from phonemes), but Markov chains are usually better when
assembling sequences of words.

markov.py was originally written by Adam "A. A." Parrish.

gibberish.py
------------

_Dependencies:_ None

A module for those interested in the appearance of Unicode
glyphs. Its main use is generating aesthetically pleasing gibberish
using selected combinations of Unicode code charts.

Example scripts for gibberish.py:

* example.gibberish.py: Prints out a 140-character string of gibberish.

* example.corrupt.py: "Corrupts" whatever text is typed in by adding
increasing numbers of diacritical marks.

gutenberg.py
------------

_Dependencies:_ `rdflib` (Only necessary if you have a copy of [Project
Gutenberg's RDF
catalog](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Feeds#Current_RDF_Format)
and you want to get extra metadata from it.)

A module for dealing with texts from Project Gutenberg.

integration.py
--------------

_Dependencies:_ python-twitter

A module for integrating Olipy with other pieces of software (notably
the Twitter API).

wordfilter.py
-------------

_Dependencies:_ None

A Python port of [Darius Kazemi's word
filter](https://npmjs.org/package/wordfilter), for finding strings
that contain racial slurs and the like.

data/
-----

This directory contains data files used by the example scripts, as
well as some miscellaneous datasets useful in text generation projects.

* ids_for_old_gutenberg_filenames.json: Maps old-style (pre-2007)
  Project Gutenberg filenames to the new-style ebook IDs. For example,
  "/etext95/3boat10.zip" is mapped to the number 308 (see
  http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/308).
