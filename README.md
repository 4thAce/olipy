olipy
=====

Olipy is a Python library for artistic text generation. It focuses on
Queneau assembly, a technique pioneered by Raymond Queneau in his 1961
book "Cent mille milliards de po√®mes" ("One hundred million million
poems"). Queneau assembly randomly creates new texts from a collection
of existing texts with identical structure.

Olipy includes several example scripts:

example.words.py: Generates common-looking and obscure-looking English
words. Demonstrates Queneau assembly on parts of a word.

example.mashteroids.py: Generates names and IAU citations for minor
planets. Demonstrates Queneau assembly on sentences.
