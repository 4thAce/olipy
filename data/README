== minor_planets.orig.json

'name', 'number' and IAU 'citation' for named minor planets
(e.g. asteroids) as of July 2013. The 'discovery' field contains
discovery circumstances. The 'suggested_by' field, when present, has
been split out from the end of the original IAU citation with a simple
heuristic. The 'citation' field has then been tokenized into sentences
using NLTK's Punkt tokenizer and a set of custom abbreviations.

== minor_planets.min.json

The same dataset as minor_planets.orig.json, but minimized to contain
only the data used by the Mashteroids project. Only 'name' and
'citation' are present. Minor planets with no citation are omitted.
