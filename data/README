== minor_planets.orig.json

'name', 'number' and IAU 'citation' for named minor planets
(e.g. asteroids) as of July 2013. The 'discovery' field contains
discovery circumstances. The 'suggested_by' field, when present, has
been split out from the end of the original IAU citation with a simple
heuristic. The 'citation' field has then been tokenized into sentences
using NLTK's Punkt tokenizer and a set of custom abbreviations.
